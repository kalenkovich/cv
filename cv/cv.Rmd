aboutme: >
  I am a data science specialist in the Bergelson lab where we study language acquisition in babies. My role is to provide technical support for research activities, including managing data and code, infrastructure and documentation, and assisting colleagues with hands-on support and guidance. I strive to improve the efficiency, reproducibility, and robustness of data processes.

  I have a background in mathematics and cognitive science, making me well-suited for my role in the lab. Prior to my current position, I led several projects in psycho- and neurolinguistics and worked as a data analyst in the banking industry.

  In my free time, I enjoy reading about the intersection of cognitive computational modeling, developmental psychology, and linguistics, and hope to make contributions to this field in the future. I also enjoy indoor bouldering and introducing friends to the sport.
