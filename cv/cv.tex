\quote{I am a research data specialist in the Bergelson lab where we
study language acquisition - babies learning language. I have a
background in mathematics and cognitive science, making me well-suited
for my role in the lab. Prior to my current position, I led several
projects in psycho- and neurolinguistics and worked as a data analyst in
the banking industry. In my free time, I enjoy reading about the
intersection of cognitive computational modeling, developmental
psychology, and linguistics, and hope to make contributions to this
field in the future. I also enjoy indoor bouldering and introducing
friends to the sport.}

\item As a Research Data Specialist, I am responsible for managing research data in various forms, including manual and automatic annotations, survey results, eye-tracking data, audio, and video. My role involves ensuring that all data  complete, up-to-date, and stored securely, while transforming it in ways that are suitable for analyzing it or making it public.%
\item To achieve this, I maintain code in the lab's R and Python packages and write one-off scripts to automate various data manipulation tasks, ensuring that they are done in a consistent manner - across repeated runs and data subsets (e.g., participants, sessions). I am the primary point of contact for computer-related matters in the lab, I provide technical support to colleagues, helping them with code, analysis, and software troubleshooting.%
\item I believe that my work plays an important role in supporting the success of the lab's research efforts. It is rewarding to work in an environment where my skills and expertise are valued and appreciated.%
