\quote{I am a research data specialist in the Bergelson lab where we
study language acquisition - babies learning language. My role is to
provide technical support for research activities, including managing
data, code, infrastructure, and documentation, and assisting colleagues
with hands-on support and guidance. I strive to improve the efficiency,
reproducibility, and robustness of data processes. I have a background
in mathematics and cognitive science, making me well-suited for my role
in the lab. Prior to my current position, I led several projects in
psycho- and neurolinguistics and worked as a data analyst in the banking
industry. In my free time, I enjoy reading about the intersection of
cognitive computational modeling, developmental psychology, and
linguistics, and hope to make contributions to this field in the future.
I also enjoy indoor bouldering and introducing friends to the sport.}

\begin{cventries}
    \cventry{Bergelson Lab}{Research Data Specialist (a.k.a. lab technician, associate in research, etc.)}{Duke University, Durham, NC}{November 2021--Present}{\begin{cvitems}
\item As a Research Data Specialist, I am responsible for managing research data in various forms, including manual and automatic annotations, survey results, eye-tracking data, audio, and video. My role involves ensuring that all data  complete, up-to-date, and stored securely, while transforming it in ways that are suitable for analyzing it or making it public.
\item To achieve this, I maintain code in the lab's R and Python packages and write one-off scripts to automate various data manipulation tasks, ensuring that they are done in a consistent manner - across repeated runs and data subsets (e.g., participants, sessions). I am the primary point of contact for computer-related matters in the lab, I provide technical support to colleagues, helping them with code, analysis, and software troubleshooting.
\item I believe that my work plays an important role in supporting the success of the lab's research efforts. It is rewarding to work in an environment where my skills and expertise are valued and appreciated.

\begin{cventries}
    \cventry{Center for Decision Making}{Research Project Lead}{HSE University, Moscow}{March 2018--Present}{\begin{cvitems}
\item I ran two follow-up experiments on the timecourse of negative sentence processing. Behavioral, mouse-tracking, online experiments. The second one had to be done online due to the COVID-19 pandemic. Transferring a mouse-tracking experiment online in a way that would closely mimic the laboratory conditions was a big challenge. Which I solved extremely well, if I may so: the experiment had several properties that no commercial online experiment service provided at that time.
\end{cvitems}}
    \cventry{Center for Decision Making}{Research Project Lead}{HSE University, Moscow}{July 2018--June 2021}{\begin{cvitems}
\item I led a study validating an alleged psychophysiological marker of hierarchical syntax processing of speech. The study was run as a registered report which was challenging but ultimately the right choice. In this project, I played all the CRediT taxonomy roles except Funding Acquisition. Our code and data are publicly available, the MEG data is in BIDS format on openneuro. The article we published about the project was my first (and currently only) first-author article.
\end{cvitems}}
    \cventry{Master's Program ``Cognitive Sciences and Technologies''}{Discussion/Practice Session Tutor}{HSE University, Moscow}{September 2018--March 2019}{\begin{cvitems}

\end{cvitems}}
    \cventry{Center for Bioelectric Interfaces}{Research Programmer}{HSE University, Moscow}{July 2017--February 2018}{\begin{cvitems}
\item I wrote software for real-time EEG source reconstruction and 3D visualization using Python, Qt, mne-python. The project involved implementation of source reconstruction algorithms and brain structures visualization in an efficient parallelized way suitable for real-time use. The development was continuted by my colleagues, the result was patented and is currently used as part of a software suite of an EEG and BIC equipment manufacturer.
\end{cvitems}}
    \cventry{Master's Program ``Cognitive Sciences and Technologies''}{Master's Student}{HSE University, Moscow}{September 2015--June 2017}{\begin{cvitems}

\end{cvitems}}
    \cventry{Psychophysiology Lab}{Research Programmer}{HSE University, Moscow}{April 2015--February 2016}{\begin{cvitems}
\item I worked on a set of studies of perceptual decision making and sustained attention using EEG. I helped with writing code (Matlab, EEGLAB) for the time-frequency analysis, multivariate statistics, and data visualization. For one of the studies I also participated in writing up the results leading to my very first scientific paper authorship.
