\section{About Me}\label{about-me}}

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  I am a Research Data Specialist in the Bergelson lab where we study
  language acquisition - babies learning language. I take care of data,
  code, and software and provide technical support in all these areas.
  My background is in Maths and Cognitive Science, so this job is
  tailor-made for me.
\item
  Before this job, I worked in research. I might do that again some day.
  I am still working on two projects from that part of my life.
\item
  In my free time, I enjoy reading about the intersection of cognitive
  computational modeling, developmental psychology, and linguistics, and
  hope to make contributions to this area in the future.
\item
  I also enjoy indoor bouldering and introducing friends to the sport.

\item performing a variety of programming/technical duties involved in managing database data, providing technical support for code and data repositories within the university and in collaboration with PI colleagues%
\item conducting data wrangling, cleaning, and/or analysis with relevant new/existing datasets%
\item review laboratory methods manual, scientific journals, abstracts and other literature for information applicable to research experiments%
\item determine and set up computers and laboratory equipment required for specific protocol%
\item maintain GitHub repositories and other web/server needs for the lab%

\item We can implement more ideas that require considerate technical effort and would otherwise have to be postponed or canceled%
\item We partially off-load technical work from my colleagues to me which both makes that work done more robustly and frees my colleagues' time to handle the non-technical, core aspects of their research%
\item I improve the smoothness of lab's operation by taking care of the lab's data, code, and technical documentation, and providing technical support to my colleagues%
\item Through code review and advice, I improve my colleagues' technical skills%
\item I save hours of manual labor by automating repetitive tasks%
