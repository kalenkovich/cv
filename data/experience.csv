"Research Data Specialist (a.k.a. lab technician, associate in research, etc.)",Bergelson Lab,current,academic,Elika Bergelson,Duke University,"Durham, NC",November 2021,Present,"As a Research Data Specialist, I am responsible for managing research data in various forms, including manual and automatic annotations, survey results, eye-tracking data, audio, and video. My role involves ensuring that all data  complete, up-to-date, and stored securely, while transforming it in ways that are suitable for analyzing it or making it public."
"Research Data Specialist (a.k.a. lab technician, associate in research, etc.)",Bergelson Lab,current,academic,Elika Bergelson,Duke University,"Durham, NC",November 2021,Present,"To achieve this, I maintain code in the lab's R and Python packages and write one-off scripts to automate various data manipulation tasks, ensuring that they are done in a consistent manner - across repeated runs and data subsets (e.g., participants, sessions). I am the primary point of contact for computer-related matters in the lab, I provide technical support to colleagues, helping them with code, analysis, and software troubleshooting."
"Research Data Specialist (a.k.a. lab technician, associate in research, etc.)",Bergelson Lab,current,academic,Elika Bergelson,Duke University,"Durham, NC",November 2021,Present,I believe that my work plays an important role in supporting the success of the lab's research efforts. It is rewarding to work in an environment where my skills and expertise are valued and appreciated.
Research Programmer,Psychophysiology Lab,previous,academic,Boris Chernyshev,HSE University,Moscow,April 2015,February 2016,"I worked on a set of studies of perceptual decision making and sustained attention using EEG. I helped with writing code (Matlab, EEGLAB) for the time-frequency analysis, multivariate statistics, and data visualization. For one of the studies I also participated in writing up the results leading to my very first scientific paper authorship."
Research Programmer,Center for Bioelectric Interfaces,previous,academic,Alexei Ossadtchi,HSE University,Moscow,July 2017,February 2018,"I wrote software for real-time EEG source reconstruction and 3D visualization using Python, Qt, mne-python. The project involved implementation of source reconstruction algorithms and brain structures visualization in an efficient parallelized way suitable for real-time use. The development was continuted by my colleagues, the result was patented and is currently used as part of a software suite of an EEG and BIC equipment manufacturer."
Research Project Lead,Center for Decision Making,previous,academic,Nina Kazanina,HSE University,Moscow,March 2018,Present,"I ran two follow-up experiments on the timecourse of negative sentence processing. Behavioral, mouse-tracking, online experiments. The second one had to be done online due to the COVID-19 pandemic. Transferring a mouse-tracking experiment online in a way that would closely mimic the laboratory conditions was a big challenge. Which I solved extremely well, if I may so: the experiment had several properties that no commercial online experiment service provided at that time."
Research Project Lead,Center for Decision Making,previous,academic,Nina Kazanina,HSE University,Moscow,July 2018,June 2021,"I led a study validating an alleged psychophysiological marker of hierarchical syntax processing of speech. The study was run as a registered report which was challenging but ultimately the right choice. In this project, I played all the CRediT taxonomy roles except Funding Acquisition. Our code and data are publicly available, the MEG data is in BIDS format on openneuro. The article we published about the project was my first (and currently only) first-author article. "
Discussion/Practice Session Tutor,"Master's Program ""Cognitive Sciences and Technologies""",previous,academic,Evgenii Osin,HSE University,Moscow,September 2018,March 2019,"Digital Signal Processing (20+ students irst-year cognitive science Master's students, ~10 sessions)."
Discussion/Practice Session Tutor,"Master's Program ""Cognitive Sciences and Technologies""",previous,academic,Alexei Ossadtchi,HSE University,Moscow,January 2017,March 2017,"Experimental Design and Statistics (two groups of ~15 students first-year cognitive science Master's students, ~25 sessions each group). I additionally incorporated an independent course on data analysis and visualization in R into the sessions."
Master's Student,"Master's Program ""Cognitive Sciences and Technologies""",previous,academic,Alexei Ossadtchi,HSE University,Moscow,September 2015,June 2017,My thesis project was on EEG source reconstruction modeling surface propagation of epileptic spikes.
Maths Tutor,-,previous,non-academic,-,Self-employed,Moscow,September 2014,May 2015,I worked with a range of students: from middle school students to graduate school applicants. I successfully helped both those struggling with maths and those interested in more advanced topics achieve their goals.
Credit Risk Analyst,"Credit Risk, Collections",previous,non-academic,"Dmitriy Shabanov, Dmitriy Ilyin",Retail Banks,Moscow,July 2011,July 2014,"I did analysis, visualization, and predicitve modeling of the risk of default for both potential new and existing customers - credit scoring and credit portfolio analyisis. SQL, SAS, Excel. Logistic regression and decision trees."
