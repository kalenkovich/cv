what,when,why
ReproducibiliTea Journal Club organizer,2020-2021,"Along with two other organizers, we ran the Moscow chapter of the ReproducibiliTea Journal Club initiative. In addition to discussing reproducibility- and replicability-related papers, we found speakers to give presentations or workshops on the topics voted for by the community."
Frequency-tagging analysis tutorial for mne-python,2020,"As a starting point for the freqtag package described above, Dominik Welke and I wrote a tutorial showing how a very basic frequency-tagging dataset can be analyzed. \href{https://mne.tools/stable/auto_tutorials/time-freq/50_ssvep.html}{Link.}"
Tutorial on writing computationally reproducible workflows for M/EEG data analysis,2021,"Out of the frustration brought by trying to reproduce (get the same results from the same data) both our own and some public M/EEG results, Egor Levchenko and I decided to write a tutorial on a way an M/EEG data analysis can be done reproducibly. It involves using package management systems (conda, renv), workflow management systems (Snakemake, nipype) and literate programming (r-markdown, codebraid)"
