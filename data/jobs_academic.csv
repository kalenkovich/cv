Independent Researcher,"",Selective adaptation study of phoneme-sized segments in speech perception,2018-present,"Phonemes are to speech approximately as vowels and consonants are to phonetic writing. They are one of the basic units in linguistics but the psycholinguistic experimental evidence for them is shaky due to the hard-to-control confounds. By combining controls employed independently in previous studies we want to test the influence of phonemes/allophones on speech perception properly. Our Stage 1 Registered Report has been rejected at QJEP after a revision. We are now working on a revised version that will incorporate the feedback we received. Work with Ekaterina Stupina."""
